[How to Install Songs]
Songs are laid out based on the group that they are in.

songs\							: root folder
	Song Pack\				: group folder
		MechaTribe Assault\		: song/simfile folder
			*.png, *.ogg, *.sm/*.ssc/etc files

[How NOT to install songs]
This won't work because StepMania expects groups:

Songs\
	Some Song\
		*.png, *.mp3/*.ogg, *.sm/*.ssc/etc files

And this won't work because StepMania doesn't handle sub-groups:

Songs\
	Song Group\
		SubGroup1\
			Some Song\
				*.png, *.mp3/*.ogg, *.sm/*.ssc/etc files
